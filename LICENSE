Copyright (c) 2025 Para
All rights reserved.

1. Definitions

1.1. "Software" means the one-click installation commands, scripts, configuration files, and any associated source code provided by the Rights Holder under this license.
1.2. "Unauthorized Copy" means any reproduction, redistribution, public posting, sale, sublicensing, inclusion in a bundle, or other transfer of the Software (in whole or in part) without a valid license from the Rights Holder.
1.3. "Licensee" means any natural or legal person to whom the Rights Holder grants a license to use the Software.

2. License Grant

2.1. Except as expressly provided in a separate written agreement signed by the Rights Holder, no license, implied license, or other right is granted to any person or entity to copy, modify, distribute, publish, sublicense, or otherwise use the Software beyond the permitted uses explicitly authorized in writing by the Rights Holder.

3. Permitted Use

3.1. The Rights Holder may, at its sole discretion, provide written permission for particular uses. Any permitted use granted in writing must be retained together with this License and the Software.

4. Prohibition on Unauthorized Use and Copying

4.1. Any person or entity that performs an Unauthorized Copy of the Software shall be in material breach of this License.
4.2. Unauthorized copying includes, without limitation, publishing the Software or any part of it on public code hosting services, websites, or private channels without written permission from the Rights Holder.

5. Liquidated Damages and Remedies

5.1. The Parties acknowledge and agree that actual damages arising from an Unauthorized Copy may be difficult to quantify. Therefore, any Licensee or individual who commits an Unauthorized Copy shall be liable to pay the Rights Holder liquidated damages in the fixed amount of INR 6,700 (six thousand seven hundred Indian Rupees) per Unauthorized Copy incident. Each separate distribution channel, public posting, or publication of substantially similar code counts as a separate incident.
5.2. The liquidated damages set forth in Section 5.1 are intended to be a genuine pre-estimate of loss and not a penalty. If a court determines any part of this liquidated damages provision is unenforceable under applicable law, the Rights Holder retains the right to pursue any other remedies available at law or in equity, including injunctive relief, actual damages, statutory damages, and recovery of legal fees and costs.
5.3. The Rights Holder may, in addition to damages, seek preliminary or permanent injunctive relief to prevent further Unauthorized Copying.

6.1. Any person or entity that uses the Software in breach of this License shall indemnify and hold harmless the Rights Holder from and against any losses, liabilities, damages, costs, and expenses (including reasonable legal fees) arising from such breach.

7. Termination

7.1. This License is effective until terminated. The Rights Holder may terminate this License immediately upon written notice if the Licensee breaches any term of this License. Upon termination, all rights granted to the Licensee under this License shall cease, and the Licensee shall discontinue all use and distribution of the Software.
